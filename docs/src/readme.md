# Project Structure

This project is organized into a structured directory layout, facilitating easy navigation and understanding of its components. Below is a breakdown of the folder structure and the purpose of each directory and file.

```

## Directory Breakdown

### `src/`
This is the main source directory containing all project-related files and subdirectories.

### `api/`
This directory contains API-related components, organized into models and pages.

- **`models/`**: This folder holds the variable bodies or objects used to call APIs. These models define the structure of the data that will be sent to and received from the API.

- **`pages/`**: This directory contains objects and functions that help call the API to set the model data. It may include methods for making requests, handling responses, and updating models.

### `assets/`
This directory is meant for static assets used in the project (e.g., images, stylesheets). The `.gitkeep` file shows it’s currently empty but is included for future use.

### `data/`
This directory contains data-related files that may provide sample data or utility functions.

- **`AssertiveStrings.js`**: This JavaScript file likely contains UI text strings or validation messages used across the application.

- **`TestData.js`**: This file probably holds sample data or mock data used for testing purposes.

### `downloads/`
A directory meant for downloaded files or resources. The `.gitkeep` file indicates it’s currently empty but is retained for version control.

### `graphql/`
This directory contains components related to GraphQL, organized into several subdirectories.

- **`models/`**: This folder holds GraphQL models that define the structure of the data used in GraphQL queries and mutations.

- **`mutations/`**: This directory is intended to contain GraphQL mutation definitions, which are used to modify data on the server.

- **`pages/`**: This directory contains objects and functions that help call GraphQL to set model data, similar to the API pages.

- **`queries/`**: This folder contains definitions for GraphQL queries, used to retrieve data from the server.

### `tests/`
This directory is dedicated to testing components of the application, organized into features and steps.

- **`features/`**: This folder is used to create Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) features written in Gherkin syntax. It defines high-level behaviors and scenarios that are easy to read and understand.

- **`pages/`**: This directory is likely to hold page objects, which represent the structure of web pages in end-to-end tests.

- **`step_definitions/`**: This folder is for defining step implementations for testing scenarios, often used in conjunction with the feature files.

### `utils/`
This directory contains utility functions and helpers that provide common functionality used throughout the application.

- **`ApiHelper.js`**: A utility module for managing API requests and responses.

- **`BrowserStorageHelper.js`**: A helper for managing data stored in the browser, such as local storage and session storage.

- **`CommonFunctions.js`**: This file contains common functions that can be reused across the application.

- **`GraphqlHelper.js`**: A utility for handling GraphQL-specific requests and operations.

- **`JsonHelper.js`**: A helper for manipulating and filtering JSON data.

- **`PlaywrightActions.js`**: A utility module for performing actions specific to Playwright, likely used in end-to-end testing.


## Notes

- The `.gitkeep` files are placeholders that ensure the respective directories are tracked in version control, even if they are currently empty.
- As the project evolves, additional files and directories may be added to enhance functionality or accommodate new features.

## Conclusion

This structured approach makes it easier to maintain and understand the codebase. By organizing files and directories by their purpose, developers can quickly locate and modify relevant components as needed.
